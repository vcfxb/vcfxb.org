The Wright Programming Language has been my longest running project; I started it in high school.
It has changed several times since I started working on it all those years ago, and now is in a bit
of a weird spot where I don't entirely know where to go with it next. It has been a wonderful tool
for me to learn about lexers, parsers, static analysis, interpreters and compilers. Now that it's
less useful to me as a learning tool (as I feel that I have generally learned the fundamentals of
all of those components) I feel that the next place for the project to go is to become a more fully
fledged software development language. Implementing that is a daunting task, one that I so far haven't
committed time to.
